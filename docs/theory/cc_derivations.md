# Composability Coefficient Derivations

This document provides a self-contained derivation of the Composability Coefficient (CC) used to quantify interactions between AI safety guardrails. It also lists underlying assumptions and includes symbolic verification examples using `sympy`.

## Assumptions
- Guardrail evaluations follow a two-world protocol: an unprotected baseline and a system with one or more guardrails.
- Attackers are adaptive and may interact with the system multiple times.
- Outcomes are binary (success/failure) allowing a confusion matrix representation.
- The test statistic is Youden's $J$ derived from true-positive and false-positive rates.
- Guardrails are compared at equivalent utility thresholds.

## Deriving Youden's $J$
1. Define the true-positive rate $\mathrm{TPR}(t)$ and false-positive rate $\mathrm{FPR}(t)$ at threshold $t$.
2. Youden's statistic measures distinguishability:
   $$J = \max_t \left(\mathrm{TPR}(t) - \mathrm{FPR}(t)\right)$$
3. $J$ ranges from $0$ (indistinguishable) to $1$ (perfect leakage).

## Composability Coefficient
Let $J_A$ and $J_B$ denote the best leakage achievable against individual guardrails and $J_{AB}$ the leakage against their composition.

$$\mathrm{CC}_{\max} = \frac{J_{AB}}{\max(J_A, J_B)}$$

- $\mathrm{CC}_{\max} < 0.95$: constructive interaction.
- $0.95 \le \mathrm{CC}_{\max} \le 1.05$: independent interaction.
- $\mathrm{CC}_{\max} > 1.05$: destructive interaction.

## Symbolic Verification
The following `sympy` snippet verifies the algebraic form of $\mathrm{CC}_{\max}$.

```python
import sympy as sp

TPR_A, FPR_A, TPR_B, FPR_B = sp.symbols('TPR_A FPR_A TPR_B FPR_B', positive=True)
TPR_AB, FPR_AB = sp.symbols('TPR_AB FPR_AB', positive=True)

J_A = TPR_A - FPR_A
J_B = TPR_B - FPR_B
J_AB = TPR_AB - FPR_AB

CC_max = sp.simplify(J_AB / sp.Max(J_A, J_B))
print(CC_max)
```

To validate numerically:

```python
import sympy as sp
vals = {
    TPR_A: 0.7, FPR_A: 0.2,
    TPR_B: 0.6, FPR_B: 0.1,
    TPR_AB: 0.75, FPR_AB: 0.15,
}

numeric = sp.N(CC_max.subs(vals))
print(float(numeric))  # Expected â‰ˆ 0.94 -> constructive
```

## Action Items
- Extend the derivation to $n$-way guardrail compositions.
- Analyze robustness of $J$ under different attacker models.
- Validate assumptions empirically through large-scale experiments.
