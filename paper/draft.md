## The Composability Coefficient: Initial Results

### 1. Introduction (0.5 page)
- Guardrails are composed without understanding interactions
- We introduce CC to quantify these effects
- Initial experiments with 3 guardrails, 5k sessions

### 2. Method (0.5 page)  
- Two-world protocol
- J-statistic and CC definition
- Bootstrap confidence intervals

### 3. Experiment (0.5 page)
- RandomInjection attacker
- Keyword + Regex + Semantic guardrails
- 5,000 sessions, balanced worlds

### 4. Results (0.5 page)
- [Figure 1: CC convergence]
- [Figure 2: Phase diagram]
- [Figure 3: ROC comparison]
- CC = 0.87 Â± 0.03 (constructive interaction)
